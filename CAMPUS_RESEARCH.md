**Notes:**
- Cardinal Red (#8C1515) is the dominant brand color; used for logos and all digital projects.
- Palo Alto Green (#175E54) is the secondary university-approved color.
- Stanford warns that unintentional conversion between CMYK and RGB/Hex can cause Cardinal Red to appear too pink or too maroon. Always start with the correct color space.

## Implementation Notes for RideOps Tenant Configs

Each campus would need:
1. A tenant JSON file (e.g., `tenants/stanford.json`) with brand colors, org name, map URL, ID field config
2. A locations JS file (e.g., `tenants/stanford-locations.js`) exporting the locations array
3. Campus-specific rules (service hours, ID validation patterns, etc.)
